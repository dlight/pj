This is a work in progress to write a stack-based VM in Rust, and in
the future, a compiler from a high level language to it.

It doesn't have a name yet, the "pj" repository name is provisional.
The name actually clashes with
[this](https://github.com/benmccormick/pj) so I would rather avoid it.

Right now there are some instructions to work with the stack, and some
test cases. It's very bare-bones.
